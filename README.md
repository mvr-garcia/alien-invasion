Alien Invasion
======

This is a project based on the namesake project from the book Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes
------

In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship
right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky
and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet
appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the playerâ€™s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player
loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
